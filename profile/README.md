## Kok Rui's coursework at the National University of Singapore

This organization acts as the home for my coursework and coursework-related tools at NUS Computing so that I don't clutter my personal profile, and so that I can archive my work and probably laugh/cringe at my past self.

Repositories which correspond to modules will be public, but each with a private submodule where I store private files.
